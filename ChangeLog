
		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 1.1.2

	o Remove C++ uses of 'register' keyword.
	o Register native routines.

		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 1.1

  o mutinfo function for mutual information is added.
  o Rarely used VR algorithm is removed.
  
		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 1.0

  o get.knn works with an integer data.frame now.
  o Fix knn.reg scaling issue when use.all is TRUE.
  
  
		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.6-4

  o Add optimal weighted knn classifier.

		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.6-3

  o Remove links to some cross-refence packages which may not-yet-installed.
  o Add suggested packages
  o Add the brute-force (linear scan) method.


		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.6-2

  o Add 1 - inner product distance measure.
  o Fix memory allocation bug for get_KNNX_kd
  

 		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.6-0

  o Fixed complier complaints on 64-sun and soloris-sparc platforms.


		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.5-9

  o Try to fix complier complaints on 64-sun and soloris-sparc platforms.
  

		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.5-8

NEW FEATURES
  o memory deallocation for cover tree is added. No more memory leaks.
 
  o memory efficient. New copies of data are no longer created in C for kd tree
    and cover tree as in VR.
     
  o new_leaf initial values changed from 0. to 0.0f in order to solve SUN Studio complaints.

BUG FIXED
  o sqrt was extra for distance for knn and knn.cv

         
		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.4

NEW FEATURES
  o added  knn crossentropy and entropy estimators.
      
  o added cover-tree and VR algorithms for KL.divergence and KL.dist.
  
  o	Self-matching:  
  	get.knnx: self-match for cover_tree and kd_tree is turned on.
	  get.knn:  self-match is turned off for "VR".
  	In summary self-match is allowed for get.knnx but not for get.knn.
      
  o	knn.reg:  remove "y" from result and rename R_square to R2Pred.
	change class from "KNNReg" to "knnReg" or "knnRegCV" depending to if test is supplied.
	

  o	KNN_ANN.cpp: remove or change variable-size array to "new" ponter to comply with ISO C++.
  o	cover_tree: remove zero padding point dimension.

BUG FIXES

  o	get.knnx: fix dimension for the nn.index and nn.dist ( change  n to m).



		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.3

NEW FEATURES

  o Index label is added for cover tree
  o	knn.index, get.knn and get.knnx include cover tree algorithm now.

		CHANGES IN FNN VERSION 0.2
		
NEW FEATURES

  o	NAMESPACE is used.
